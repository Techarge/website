For our latest client, we are pleased to announce the launch of https://emsx.vet. The purpose of this platform is to assist Vet students undertaking their studies in the UK to find work experience placements as part of thier extra murial studies. The site has a comprehensive list of all vet practises in the UK and allows students to search a given location and filter by requirements such as speciality or species. 

Vet students can create an account on the platform and save a list of their favourite vet practises as well as apply directly to each practise either on mobile or desktop. The site was built and launched in record time (<6m from initial design through to implementation, testing and deployment). We choose a mixed tech stack of Wagtail/Django to allow for easier management of vet practise information mixed with Svelte in the frontend to provide a fast and responsive frontend for users.
