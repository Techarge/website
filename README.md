# Techarge website
This site is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)
and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

After installing hugo, run the test site using: 
```
cd techarge
npm i 
npm run dev
```

We also use alpinejs and turbolinks. Note you will need to install latest versions of `go` and `git`:
```
hugo mod get -u ./...
```
